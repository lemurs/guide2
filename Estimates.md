### Decomposition

1. Go through the mockups and describe[1] every piece of functionality in terms of user stories[2]
  * What do the buttons and other controls do?
  * What segues are there and where do they do?
  * What has a color, font, or other customization?
  * Where do the images or text come from?
2. Assign each user story a [difficulty](./Difficulty.md) estimate.
  * Split or combine into individual issues as you go.
3. Assign each issue a [priority](./Priority.md) level.
4. Calculate time estimates by adding difficulties and multiplying the sum by the accuracy coefficient[3]
  * p x Pp x d x Td * cA (priority x probability x difficulty x time x accuracy)
5. Adjust priorities accordingly.

### Notes

1. __Issue Trackers__ are numerous. Pick a good one. I recommend GitHub.
2. __User Stories__ are brief descriptions of an interaction one can have with the product.
  * I need to log in.
  * I want to set my profile picture.
  * I want to read my messages.
  * I want to write a message.
  * I want to edit my message.
  * I want to save my changes.
3. Start with 2 or 3 and adjust as you measure your ability to make accurate estimates.
