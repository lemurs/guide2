### Difficulty Levels

You can think of difficulty in terms of forward time or backward time. They are equivalent amounts of time, but may feel different psychologically. It's probably good to keep both in mind.

D will take at least:

1. A few minutes
2. A few hours

4. A few days
5. A week or more

D will take at most:

1. Less than an hour
2. Less than half a day
3. Less than a day
4. Less than half a week
5. A week or more

### Summation

1. 1 Hour - 0.2 Days
2. 0.5 Days - 2.5 Hours
3. 1 Day - 5 Hours
4. 3 Days - 15 Hours
5. Incalculable: flag or break down further

5 hours = 1 day
5 days = 1 week
20 days = 1 month
